You'll be working with services such as Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection), Amazon Macie (discover, classify & protect data), Amazon Inspector (vulnerability & behavior analysis), AWS Security Hub (centralized security view). You will learn how to use these services to investigate threats during and after an attack, set up a notification and response pipeline, and add additional protections to improve the security posture of your environment.",
